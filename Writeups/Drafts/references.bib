  abstract={In this paper I develop a quantitative dynamic spatial model of global economic development over the long run. There is an agricultural (ancient) sector and a non-agricultural (modern) sector. Innovation, technology diffusion, and population growth are endogenous. A set of plausible parameter restrictions makes this model susceptible to analysis using classic network theory concepts. Aggregate connectivity is summarized by the largest eigenvalue of the matrix of inverse iceberg transport costs, and the long-run path of the world economy displays threshold behavior. If transport costs are high enough, the world remains in a stagnant, Malthusian steady state; if they are low enough enough, this sets off an endogenous process of sustained growth in population and income. Taking the model to the data, I divide the world into 16,000 1 degree by 1 degree quadrangles. I infer bilateral transport costs by calculating the cheapest route between each pair of locations given the placement of rivers, oceans and mountains. I infer a series of global transport networks using historical estimates of the costs of transport over land and water and their evolution over time. I then simulate the evolution of population and income from the year 1000 until the year 2000 CE. I use the model to calculate two sets of location-specific efficiency parameters, one for the ancient sector and one for the modern sector, that rationalize both the year 1000 population distribution and the year 2000 distribution of income per capita. I then calculate the relative contributions of each set of efficiency wedges, and key historical shifts in transport costs, to the year 2000 variance of per-capita real income.},

  abstract={ This paper studies the spatial implications of structural change. By shifting demand towards non-agricultural goods, the structural transformation benefits workers in urban centers and hurts rural locations. At the aggregate level, the economy can respond either through a reallocation of labor from rural to urban areas or through a reduction in agricultural employment within a given location. Using detailed spatial data for the U.S. between 1880 and 2000, we show that spatial reallocation accounts for almost none of the aggregate decline in agricultural employment. We interpret this fact through the lens of a novel quantitative theory of spatial structural change, and show that the absence of the spatial reallocation channel is primarily due to regional productivity shocks, which almost entirely offset the urban bias of the structural transformation. Frictions to labor mobility meanwhile are quantitatively unimportant. The model implies that spatial welfare differences declined substantially during the United States' structural transformation and that the spatial reallocation of factors can account for about 15\% of aggregate growth since 1880.},

abstract = {Between 2000 and 2015, China’s aggregate income quadrupled, its provincial income inequality fell by a third, and its share of employment in agriculture fell by a half. Internal migration is central to this transformation, with the number of internal migrant workers reaching 300 million by 2015. Combining rich data on migration with a spatial general equilibrium model of China’s economy, we quantify the size and the impact of internal migration cost reductions in China between 2000 and 2015. During the 15-year period, China’s internal migration costs fell by forty-five percent. In addition to contributing substantially to growth, these migration cost changes account for the majority of the reallocation of workers out of agriculture and the drop in regional inequality. We compare the effect of migration policy changes with other important economic changes, including changes in trade costs, capital market distortions, average cost of capital, and productivity. While each contributes meaningfully to growth, migration policy changes are central to China’s structural change and regional income convergence. We also find that the recent slow-down in aggregate economic growth between 2010 and 2015 is associated with smaller reduction in inter-provincial migration costs and a larger role of capital accumulation.}

We use theory and empirical evidence to show this pattern of population growth is the result of differences in agriculture's initial share of employment across population densities, combined with structural transformation that shifts employment away from agriculture.}",
